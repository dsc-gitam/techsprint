While modern safety systems focus on detecting accidents or reacting in real time, the majority of accidents are actually preceded by days or weeks of ignored near-misses, risky driving patterns, fatigue, and behavioral degradation. Current driver-assistance systems: React only at the moment of danger Depend heavily on expensive vehicle hardware Fail to identify long-term behavioral risk trends As a result, drivers receive warnings too late, after unsafe habits have already formed. There is a critical gap for an intelligent, software-first system that can: Analyze driving behavior over time Identify subtle near-miss patterns and risk escalation Warn drivers before an accident becomes inevitable The challenge is to design a system that works without specialized hardware, is scalable, and can evolve from mobile-based deployment to full vehicle integration. 🎯 Objective Build an AI-powered accident prevention system that: Learns from driving behavior trends rather than crash events Predicts rising accident risk days in advance Provides proactive, preventive warnings to drivers This system should demonstrate how behavioral intelligence can shift road safety from reaction to prevention. 🌍 Impact A successful solution could: Reduce accidents caused by fatigue, distraction, and stress Enable early intervention instead of emergency response Create a scalable safety layer deployable on phones, vehicles, and fleets.","AI-Driven Accident Prevention System We propose a software-first AI system that prevents road accidents by predicting rising accident risk days before a crash occurs, instead of reacting at the moment of danger. The core idea is to treat accidents not as sudden events, but as the final outcome of repeated near-miss behaviors such as late braking, aggressive acceleration, micro-swerving, and fatigue-driven inconsistency. 🧠 How the Solution Works 1️⃣ Behavioral Data Ingestion The system ingests driving behavior data such as: Braking intensity Acceleration and jerk patterns Swerving and sharp turns Frequency of risky maneuvers over time For the hackathon demo, this data is simulated or replayed, representing realistic driving sessions over multiple days. 2️⃣ Feature Extraction & Trend Analysis Raw motion data is converted into behavioral risk features, including: Sudden braking spikes Reaction delay indicators Driving smoothness variance Near-miss frequency trends Instead of evaluating isolated events, the system analyzes behavioral drift over time. 3️⃣ Risk Intelligence Engine (ML Layer) An anomaly-detection and trend-based ML model learns: What “normal driving behavior” looks like How risk patterns escalate gradually When the driver’s behavior deviates toward danger The model outputs a Driver Risk Score (0–100) that evolves across days, not seconds. 4️⃣ Preventive Warning System When the system detects a consistent upward risk trend, it triggers a pre-accident warning, such as: “Braking reaction time has worsened by 30% over the last 4 days” “Near-miss frequency increasing on evening routes” These alerts are preventive, not reactive — issued before any accident occurs.","Data:CSV/JSON,Ml:Isolation Forest / Logistic Regression,Backend:Python,UI:Streamlit,Demo:Pre-recorded playback",

Silent SOS is designed to work in panic situations where speed and simplicity are critical. The user opens the application and triggers an emergency by tapping a single SOS button—no login, no typing, and no phone call required.

Once activated, the system automatically captures the user’s real-time GPS location without requiring any manual input. This eliminates confusion during emergencies and ensures accurate positioning. The user then selects the type of emergency—Medical, Safety/Harassment, or Accident—so responders can understand the situation and prepare appropriately before reaching the location. The alert is instantly transmitted to multiple endpoints, including campus security or a control room, nearby registered volunteers, and a centralized admin dashboard.

On the live admin dashboard, authorities can view the exact location on a map along with the emergency type, timestamp, and alert status (New, Acknowledged, or Resolved).

Many small and marginal farmers do not have access to soil testing facilities and rely on traditional knowledge, which may not always result in optimal crop yield. Additionally, farmers frequently encounter crop diseases and pests but lack timely expert guidance to identify these problems and apply appropriate treatments. Another major challenge is the communication gap between farmers and agricultural experts, especially for farmers who are not literate or are comfortable only in their local language. Existing agricultural platforms are mostly text-based, limited in regional language support, and do not provide real-time, personalized assistance. Therefore, there is a need for an intelligent, user-friendly system that can recommend suitable crops based on soil nutrients and district-wise environmental data, assist farmers in identifying crop diseases using images, and provide solutions through a conversational interface in local languages using both text and voice.","Proposed Solution This project aims to develop an AI-based Crop Recommendation and Farmer Assistance System that: Recommends suitable crops based on soil nutrient content or district-wise data for farmers who are unaware of their soil composition. Predicts possible crop diseases from uploaded crop images and suggests appropriate preventive and corrective measures. Provides a multilingual AI chatbot that answers farmer queries in local languages using both text and audio.

The platform also includes a verification and rating mechanism to ensure service reliability and user safety. All service interactions are logged for monitoring and future improvement.
