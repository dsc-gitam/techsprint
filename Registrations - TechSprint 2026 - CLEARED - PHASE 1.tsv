The rapid growth of social media platforms and generative AI technologies has significantly increased the spread of fake news, manipulated images, and deepfake videos. Current verification systems typically analyze only a single modality text, image, or video making them ineffective against multimodal misinformation. Additionally, most existing solutions lack explainability, reducing user trust. There is a critical need for a unified, real-time system that can analyze text, images, and videos together, accurately detect fake content, and provide transparent, explainable results.	We developed a Multimodal Fake Content Detector that analyzes text, images, and videos simultaneously to identify fake or manipulated content. The system uses AI models for each modality and combines their predictions through a fusion engine to generate a single confidence-based verdict. An Explainable AI layer highlights suspicious text, image regions, and video frames, ensuring transparency and user trust. The final output clearly labels content as REAL, SUSPICIOUS, or FAKE with an explanation.	Y

Most websites are not built with dyslexic readers in mind, increasing cognitive load and making comprehension difficult. Existing accessibility tools mainly focus on font changes or text‑to‑speech, which do not adequately support understanding or sustained focus. There is a need for a universal solution that works across websites to reduce visual stress, simplify language, and actively support comprehension for dyslexic users.  	We propose an AI‑powered browser extension that helps dyslexic users read and understand web content more easily. The extension adapts text layout to reduce visual stress, provides a focus mode to improve concentration, and uses AI to simplify complex language on demand. It also offers read‑aloud support to reinforce comprehension. By working directly on any website, the solution enables dyslexic users to access information more comfortably without leaving the page they are reading.	Y

Oral cancer is frequently underdiagnosed, especially in low-resource settings, due to the visual similarity between benign, precancerous, and cancerous oral lesions. Current diagnosis relies largely on manual examination, which is subjective and can result in delayed or incorrect treatment. Existing AI solutions mainly perform binary classification and fail to represent disease progression or provide explainable insights. This creates a critical need for a lightweight, progression-aware, and explainable system that can accurately identify oral lesions across multiple stages and support early clinical intervention.	We propose a deep learning–based system that goes beyond conventional disease detection by performing progression-aware multiclass classification of oral lesions. Instead of only identifying whether a lesion is abnormal, the system determines the stage of disease progression across clinically relevant categories.

Current solutions are often too complex, expensive, or focused on raw data rather than decision-making. Consequently, industries contribute to unmanaged emissions and persistent chemical pollution—such as PFAS, POPs, and heavy metals—which cause long-term harm to human health, animals, and global ecosystems.	We are building EcoGuard (a phase of EcoSphere AI), an AI-powered industrial environmental intelligence and decision-support system. Unlike raw data sensors, EcoGuard uses Google Gemini to translate complex environmental research into actionable intelligence for plant managers and sustainability officers. The platform identifies likely chemical pollutants based on industry type (e.g., Textile, Pharma), maps their environmental pathways through air, water, and soil, and provides practical, low-cost mitigation and waste-management strategies .

Farmers often rely on intermediaries to sell their produce, leading to low profits, lack of price transparency, and limited market access, while consumers face higher prices and uncertainty about product quality and origin. There is a need for a digital platform that directly connects farmers and consumers to enable transparent communication, fair pricing, secure transactions, and efficient delivery of locally sourced agricultural produce.	Krishi Bazaar is website designed to bridge the gap between farmers and consumers by providing a platform for direct communication and transaction. The app allows farmers to list their produce for sale and consumers to browse and purchase products directly from the farmer.  Farmers can create a profile, add their produce with details such as quantity, quality, and price. Consumers can search for products by category, location, and other filters. They can also view the farmer's profile, read reviews, and connect with them to discuss product details or negotiate prices.  The app also offers a payment gateway for secure transactions and facilitates delivery arrangements between the farmer and the consumer. It aims to promote transparency, traceability, and fair pricing in the agricultural value chain, while also supporting small farmers and promoting local, sustainable food systems.  Overall, the Farmer Consumer Connect website aims to create a more efficient and equitable market for both farmers and consumers, while also promoting the benefits of buying locally sourced, fresh, and seasonal produce.

In India, people facing everyday legal situations often struggle to understand which laws may be relevant, what facts actually matter, and what their basic rights and procedures are. Existing platforms are either too complex or provide misleading certainty, leaving users more confused instead of informed.	The solution is an ethical legal awareness application that allows users to describe their situation in plain language and then explores possible legal domains, relevant laws, rights, and procedures. The system emphasizes uncertainty, asks fact-clarifying questions, and educates users, helping them become better informed before approaching professionals.	Y

Users provide basic personal information such as date of birth, state, education level, income range, and employment status. Based on this information, the system applies rule-based eligibility logic using data collected from official government notifications stored in a structured database. An AI-assisted layer is used to simplify complex government documents and clearly explain eligibility results in an easy-to-understand language. The system displays only relevant opportunities along with required documents, application procedures, deadlines, and exam syllabus details. Additionally, users receive notifications when new eligible opportunities become available or when important deadlines approach.

Most small and marginal farmers rely on guesswork for crop selection, irrigation, pest control, and market decisions, leading to low productivity and frequent financial losses. Limited internet connectivity in rural areas restricts access to existing agri-tech platforms, while language and digital literacy barriers exclude many farmers from using mobile applications. In addition, inefficient water usage due to manual irrigation practices results in crop stress and resource wastage. Farmers are also affected by middlemen exploitation, lack of transparent market pricing, high equipment costs, and the absence of integrated decision-making tools that support them throughout the entire farming lifecycle. These challenges highlight the urgent need for a simple, inclusive, offline-capable, and native-language farming support system that empowers farmers with accurate, real-time, and end-to-end agricultural assistance.	Kisan Mitra AI is an AI-powered, voice-first, offline-capable smart farming ecosystem designed to support farmers from sowing to selling. The platform allows farmers to interact entirely through voice commands in Telugu, eliminating the need for typing or digital literacy. Farmers receive AI-driven crop recommendations based on soil type, location, season, and weather conditions, along with pest and disease detection using simple mobile images.A key innovation of Kisan Mitra AI is its personalized daily farming checklist, which automatically guides farmers on what tasks to perform each day, such as irrigation, pest monitoring, fertilizer application, and weather precautions. The checklist is dynamically generated based on crop stage, soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and farmer preferences, and is delivered through voice prompts in the local language. The system also integrates an AI-based smart irrigation solution that operates without manual intervention. Using soil moisture sensors, irrigation is automatically turned ON when the soil becomes dry and turned OFF when adequate moisture is achieved, ensuring optimal water usage. Farmers can monitor and control irrigation remotely through a simple mobile interface or voice commands, even in low-connectivity environments. The irrigation system continues to function offline and uses SMS alerts for critical updates. Additionally, Kisan Mitra AI provides real-time market price insights, transparent blockchain-based supply chain tracking to reduce middlemen exploitation, and a community-driven equipment-sharing marketplace that allows farmers to rent or share costly machinery at affordable rates. Built on an offline-first architecture, the platform ensures continuous functionality using local data caching and SMS fallback, making it highly suitable for rural and low-internet regions. By combining AI, IoT, blockchain, and community collaboration, Kisan Mitra AI empowers farmers with smarter decisions, reduced costs, improved productivity, and increased income.  Expected Impact Reduced crop losses due to timely irrigation and pest alerts Improved water efficiency and lower electricity costs Increased farmer income through better crop planning and fair pricing Empowerment of farmers with minimal digital literacy Sustainable and data-driven agriculture for rural India	Y

Many users, especially non-technical individuals, fall victim to fraudulent messages and malicious links due to lack of awareness and inability to identify suspicious content. These scams often impersonate trusted organizations, create urgency, or promise rewards, leading to financial loss, identity theft, and privacy breaches.	Existing solutions mainly rely on static blacklists or manual reporting, which are often ineffective against newly emerging scams and provide limited explanation to users. There is a need for an intelligent, user-friendly system that not only detects potential scams in real time but also educates users about online safety and scam patterns.  This project aims to develop a Cyber Safety and Scam Awareness Tool that analyzes user-provided links and messages using a multi-layered approach including rule-based detection, machine learning, behavioral pattern analysis, and URL reputation checks. The system generates a risk score, provides explainable warnings, and offers educational insights to help users make informed decisions before interacting with suspicious content.  By combining intelligent detection with awareness and transparency, the proposed system helps prevent online fraud and promotes safer digital behavior among users.	Y

They attend classes, submit assignments, and appear “fine” on the surface, while internally dealing with burnout, exhaustion, or loss of motivation. Most students do not openly ask for help, and by the time educators notice a problem, academic performance has already dropped or the student is close to giving up. Current support systems rely heavily on surveys, self-reporting, or visible failure, which means help often arrives too late. There is a genuine gap between when a student begins to struggle and when support reaches them. What is missing is a respectful, non-intrusive way to notice these early signs and offer support before a student feels overwhelmed or invisible.	Silent Struggle is a gentle, privacy first support system designed to identify early signs of burnout and disengagement in students before they turn into academic or emotional crises. The system works by learning each student’s normal academic behavior over time such as login consistency, assignment submission patterns, and participation regularity without accessing any personal messages or sensitive information. When meaningful changes from a student’s usual pattern are detected, the system generates a simple risk indicator rather than a diagnosis. This indicator helps mentors, educators, or support staff reach out at the right moment with understanding and support.

During such situations, users lose important actions like form submissions, attendance, likes, or messages. At the same time, the app experience breaks completely as content such as videos, reels, or lessons stop loading. This creates blank screens, failed actions, and frustration for users. Although some large apps handle parts of this problem internally, their solutions are app-specific and complex. Small developers, startups, and public service apps often cannot afford to build such systems. This problem is common in rural areas, during travel, power cuts, or network congestion. Students, doctors, and citizens are especially affected by unreliable digital services. As a result, users lose time, data, and trust in digital platforms. There is a need for a simple, reusable, and affordable solution that keeps apps usable even when the internet fails.  "While scrolling Instagram reels, if the internet suddenly goes off, new reels stop loading and the app becomes unusable. This shows how apps fail to handle internet interruptions and break the user experience."	1.A Universal App Inverter Platform inspired by electrical inverters that keeps apps working during internet outages.  2.When internet is available, it stores important user actions and preloads relevant content within safe limits.  3.When internet goes off, users can still view content and perform actions without interruption.  4.All offline actions automatically sync back to the server when connectivity returns.  5.Unlike existing solutions, it combines data reliability and content continuity in one plug-and-play platform.  6.Offered as a developer SDK with free basic features, paid advanced plans, and enterprise licensing.  7.Helps students, healthcare workers, citizens, and everyday users by reducing the digital gap caused by unstable internet.

This fails to solve the root cause of financial instability for Gen Z and gig workers: Impulse Buying and "Doom Spending" (emotional spending). Users have income but lack the real-time discipline to pause, evaluate, and reject unnecessary purchases in the moment.	Fincil replaces the passive tracker with an Active "Agentic" Council. Instead of a lonely decision, every purchase request triggers a real-time debate between three AI agents:  The Miser (Risk Agent): Ruthlessly protects your savings and cites your past wasteful habits.  The Visionary (Growth Agent): Advocates for purchases that have high utility or ROI.  The Twin (Judge): Issues a final verdict based on your specific financial goals.  The system features a unique "Rebuttal Loop" (Human-in-the-Loop). If the Council says "No," the user can argue their case (e.g., "I have extra cash this month"), forcing the agents to re-evaluate the decision based on the new context—turning financial discipline into a gamified negotiation.

Not because they are weak, but because their brains have been tricked into believing these addictions help them feel better, reduce stress, or escape problems. In reality, these habits slowly destroy confidence, focus, relationships, and mental health.  Authors like Allen Carr (quit smoking) and the “Easy Peasy Way to Quit Porn” method have already proven that addiction can be beaten by changing how people think about the addiction, not by forcing willpower or restriction. These books have changed many lives and helped people break free by showing them that the addiction gives nothing and only takes. ​  But there is a big problem: people today are so used to short-term dopamine (reels, shorts, endless scrolling) that they cannot sit and read a book or remember its lessons for long. Even if they read once and feel motivated, life goes back to normal, they forget the key ideas, and the old addiction patterns return. The knowledge is powerful, but it is not reinforced daily.  So the real issue is this: we already have powerful methods to quit, but they are locked in books that people either never finish, never apply consistently, or quickly forget. There is no simple, personalized, daily system that takes these proven ideas and feeds them to the modern, distracted brain in small, engaging, consistent doses until the old brainwashing is fully broken and the person no longer wants the addiction.  Research validation:     1) Smoking: India has around 100 million smokers and over 250 million tobacco users, with both men and women affected, including school-going youth. Source : https://gsthr.org/countries/profile/ind/1/  2) Porn: India is among the top countries in porn consumption; studies show millions of adults and many young people use porn, with a significant share showing addiction-like patterns, in both men and women. Source : https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12242039/  3) Social media: Around one-third of Indian students show social media addiction like behavior, with heavy daily use linked to anxiety, poor sleep, and lower academic performance. Source : https://sanaroohealthcare.com/social-media-addiction-and-mental-health-the-hidden-epidemic-among-indian-youth  4) Relapse is high: Across addictions, 40–60% of people relapse within 1 year, even after treatment, showing that willpower and standard methods are not enough.  Source : https://www.addictionhelp.com/recovery/statistics/  5) Debrainwashing works: Debrainwashing  methods show higher quit rates (up to ~50% long-term for smoking) by changing beliefs about the addiction instead of relying on willpower  Source : https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10540232/	Our solution is a personalized addiction recovery app designed to address the three most common modern addictions: Porn Smoking Social media Instead of offering generic advice, the app adapts entirely to the user’s real struggles. On onboarding, users select one or more addictions they want to work on, and the experience is tailored accordingly.  🧠 Core Philosophy: Truth Over Illusion At the heart of the app are 1–2 minute “micro-lessons” designed for short attention spans and daily consistency. These lessons are inspired by principles from methods like Allen Carr’s approach and EasyPeasy, but rewritten in our own words and structure for today’s digital generation.  Each snippet focuses on: Exposing false beliefs behind addiction (e.g., “This calms me,” “This helps my stress,” “This makes me happy”) Showing how the addiction actually creates the pain it promises to solve Offering healthier, realistic alternatives to respond to cravings The goal is not discipline through fear, but mental clarity through truth.  Habit Building (Without Pressure) Users can choose a streak goal (e.g., 21 days, 30 days, or longer). By completing daily snippets and short reflections, they: Build consistency Unlock small, meaningful upgrades Feel progress without gamifying recovery in a shallow way The focus is growth, not guilt.   Gentle Support System On Android (and where iOS allows), users can enable a persistent, soft reminder notification — a calm signal that support is always one tap away when urges arise.   🚨 Emergency Button (Core Feature) When cravings hit, users can press the Emergency Button. The app will then: Ask how they feel right now (stressed, lonely, bored, empty, etc.) Show their own past reflections and relapse notes, reminding them how it actually felt afterward Contrast “life before addiction vs life during addiction”, using memories or photos they chose to save Display short, powerful truth lines and motivational reminders to break the craving loop This feature helps interrupt impulsive behavior using self-awareness, memory, and emotional grounding.   🤝 Community & Shared Growth Users can optionally join a supportive community space where they can: Share daily reflections Post streak updates Be honest about relapses Reactions are simple and supportive (e.g., “Respect”, “I relate”), keeping the space safe and non-judgmental. For those who want more engagement, there’s an optional recovery-only vertical feed (similar to reels), limited strictly to: Wins Lessons Real recovery stories This allows mindful scrolling without exposure to toxic or addictive content.   🌱 The Bigger Goal This app isn’t about forcing control or willpower. It’s about changing what people believe about their addictions  until the desire itself slowly weakens and fades.   We’ll continuously refine the experience through real user feedback and expert input, while staying true to this core philosophy: Freedom comes from clarity, not suppression.  Feasablity, Innovation, Creativity these 3 aspects we want to expand and work on. 	Y

AI: Google Gemini API. Backend (optional): Firebase	Many college students miss out on hackathons, internships, scholarships, competitions, and learning opportunities because information is scattered across WhatsApp groups, notice boards, emails, and websites.  These announcements are usually generic, not personalized, and often reach students too late. Colleges also lack a system that guides students based on their academic year, domain, skill level, and career goals.  As a result, capable students believe they are not suitable for opportunities, not because of lack of talent, but due to lack of awareness and guidance. This creates a major gap between student potential and student participation.	CampusIQ is an AI-powered Student Mentor and Opportunity Awareness Platform that acts as a personalized guide for college students.  Using Google Gemini AI, the platform understands a student’s academic year, domain, interests, and career goals to recommend relevant hackathons, internships, competitions, and learning paths.  Unlike traditional helpdesk chatbots, CampusIQ explains why an opportunity is suitable, what skills are required, how to prepare, and when to apply.  It also includes a smart college helpdesk mode to answer common academic and administrative queries, making the solution practical, deployable, and scalable across colleges.

Students are required to balance multiple subjects, assignments, examinations, and projects simultaneously, often without a clear understanding of what to study, when to study, and how to study effectively.  First and second-year students are particularly affected, as they are still adapting to the academic rigor and self-directed learning environment of higher education. Existing tools such as calendars, note-taking apps, and task managers are either fragmented, overly complex, or lack personalization. As a result, students experience inefficient time utilization, missed deadlines, reduced productivity, increased academic stress, and suboptimal learning outcomes.  Additionally, while students focus on academics, they often remain unprepared for interviews and placement readiness due to the absence of structured interview practice and feedback mechanisms. There is a clear need for a unified, intelligent system that supports both academic planning and career preparedness in a simple and student-friendly manner.	To address these challenges, Team Binary Brains proposes an AI-powered Smart Student Companion—a unified web-based platform designed to assist students in effective academic planning, focused learning, and interview preparedness using artificial intelligence.  The platform generates personalized daily study plans by analyzing a student’s subjects, academic deadlines, and available study time. Large syllabi and complex topics are systematically broken down into smaller, manageable tasks, ensuring clarity, consistency, and improved daily learning outcomes. Students can upload notes and PDF documents, which are automatically summarized using AI to extract key concepts and reduce information overload.  In addition to academic support, the Smart Student Companion features an AI-driven interview preparation module. Students can upload their resumes, based on which the AI dynamically generates role-specific and resume-focused interview questions. The system conducts simulated interview sessions, evaluates both text-based and voice-based responses, and provides structured feedback to improve communication skills, technical clarity, confidence, and overall interview readiness.  Furthermore, the platform tracks task completion and learning progress through an intuitive dashboard, offering actionable insights, focus recommendations, and productivity guidance. By integrating academic planning, content summarization, progress monitoring, resume-based interview practice, and feedback-driven improvement into a single platform, the Smart Student Companion enables students to study smarter, manage time efficiently, and reduce academic stress.  This solution is practical, scalable, and student-centric, making it suitable not only as a hackathon prototype but also as a viable real-world educational product with long-term impact.	Y

Similarly, existing digital educational tools fail to deliver the intuitive, kinesthetic experience of physical whiteboards and are often inaccessible to users with physical disabilities.  Most current solutions either require specialized hardware (VR, Kinect), focus only on engagement without quantitative motor assessment, or use limited gesture-based interactions. There is a need for an accessible, webcam-based system that enables natural hand-gesture interaction while providing objective analysis of motor skills for therapeutic and educational use.	We propose an AI-Powered Therapeutic and Educational Air Canvas, a dual-purpose virtual canvas controlled using real-time, markerless hand gestures captured through a standard webcam.  The system allows users to draw and interact in mid-air while a machine learning module analyzes hand movement kinematics to quantify smoothness, precision, and tremor. These metrics provide objective, data-driven feedback for therapists and clinicians.  In an educational context, the platform serves as an inclusive and engaging interactive tool that mimics the experience of a physical whiteboard. Additionally, the system integrates a generative AI co-creator that assists users by refining or completing sketches, supporting users with motor impairments and enabling human-AI collaboration.  The platform is designed to be low-cost, accessible, and deployable without any special hardware.

Traditional security systems primarily focus on prevention but provide limited visibility into attacker behavior once an intrusion attempt begins. This lack of real-time insight makes it difficult for defenders to understand attack patterns, intentions, and techniques. There is a need for a secure cyber deception system that can safely lure attackers, monitor their actions in real time, and provide meaningful analysis without exposing real infrastructure.	CyberSentry V2 is a cyber deception platform that deploys multiple SSH honeypots to safely attract and monitor attackers in real time. The system captures attacker activities such as login attempts and executed commands, processes them through a backend server, and displays live insights on a centralized dashboard. This approach improves threat visibility while protecting actual network infrastructure.	N

While modern safety systems focus on detecting accidents or reacting in real time, the majority of accidents are actually preceded by days or weeks of ignored near-misses, risky driving patterns, fatigue, and behavioral degradation. Current driver-assistance systems: React only at the moment of danger Depend heavily on expensive vehicle hardware Fail to identify long-term behavioral risk trends As a result, drivers receive warnings too late, after unsafe habits have already formed. There is a critical gap for an intelligent, software-first system that can: Analyze driving behavior over time Identify subtle near-miss patterns and risk escalation Warn drivers before an accident becomes inevitable The challenge is to design a system that works without specialized hardware, is scalable, and can evolve from mobile-based deployment to full vehicle integration. 🎯 Objective Build an AI-powered accident prevention system that: Learns from driving behavior trends rather than crash events Predicts rising accident risk days in advance Provides proactive, preventive warnings to drivers This system should demonstrate how behavioral intelligence can shift road safety from reaction to prevention. 🌍 Impact A successful solution could: Reduce accidents caused by fatigue, distraction, and stress Enable early intervention instead of emergency response Create a scalable safety layer deployable on phones, vehicles, and fleets.	AI-Driven Accident Prevention System We propose a software-first AI system that prevents road accidents by predicting rising accident risk days before a crash occurs, instead of reacting at the moment of danger. The core idea is to treat accidents not as sudden events, but as the final outcome of repeated near-miss behaviors such as late braking, aggressive acceleration, micro-swerving, and fatigue-driven inconsistency. 🧠 How the Solution Works 1️⃣ Behavioral Data Ingestion The system ingests driving behavior data such as: Braking intensity Acceleration and jerk patterns Swerving and sharp turns Frequency of risky maneuvers over time For the hackathon demo, this data is simulated or replayed, representing realistic driving sessions over multiple days. 2️⃣ Feature Extraction & Trend Analysis Raw motion data is converted into behavioral risk features, including: Sudden braking spikes Reaction delay indicators Driving smoothness variance Near-miss frequency trends Instead of evaluating isolated events, the system analyzes behavioral drift over time. 3️⃣ Risk Intelligence Engine (ML Layer) An anomaly-detection and trend-based ML model learns: What “normal driving behavior” looks like How risk patterns escalate gradually When the driver’s behavior deviates toward danger The model outputs a Driver Risk Score (0–100) that evolves across days, not seconds. 4️⃣ Preventive Warning System When the system detects a consistent upward risk trend, it triggers a pre-accident warning, such as: “Braking reaction time has worsened by 30% over the last 4 days” “Near-miss frequency increasing on evening routes” These alerts are preventive, not reactive — issued before any accident occurs.

Current healthcare systems often struggle with delayed diagnosis, inconsistent glucose monitoring, and a lack of personalized intervention, leading to preventable complications. 	The Core Solution We have built a Quantum-Enhanced Hybrid Intelligence System that transforms gestational diabetes care from reactive (treating spikes) to proactive (preventing them). 1. Data Acquisition (The Inputs) Continuous Monitoring: Real-time glucose data from CGM sensors and physical activity from wearables. Biometric Sync: Automated data flow via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a dedicated mobile app. 2. The Intelligence Engine (The Processing) We use a "Hybrid" model to get the best of both worlds: Classical AI (XGBoost/LSTM): Handles the day-to-day data processing and predicts immediate glucose trends. Quantum ML (QSVM/VQC): Uses Quantum Kernels and Entanglement to analyze complex metabolic patterns. It identifies high-risk GDM complications (like macrosomia) that classical computers are statistically blind to. 3. Intervention & Security (The Outputs) Virtual Health Coach: An AI-driven app provides instant, trimester-specific feedback on nutrition and insulin dosing. Clinician Dashboard: Alerts doctors to high-risk patients using risk-stratification.

However, a major issue remains unnoticed: users who start a digital task but silently fail to complete it.  Existing support systems like chatbots are reactive and depend on users actively seeking help. In reality, many users abandon processes due to confusion, repeated errors, language barriers, or complex workflows—without reporting the issue. These silent failures remain invisible, leading to poor user experience, digital exclusion, and incorrect system performance metrics.  There is currently no proactive mechanism to detect user struggle during the interaction itself and identify where and why digital systems fail their users.	We propose an AI-assisted User Failure Detection System that proactively identifies silent user struggle by analyzing anonymized interaction patterns such as idle time, repeated corrections, navigation loops, and error retries.  The system detects potential failure points in real time, classifies the cause of user difficulty, and provides actionable insights to improve accessibility, usability, and system reliability. This shifts digital platforms from reactive support to proactive system accountability, ensuring that success is measured not only by completion, but by the system’s ability to support all users effectively.

Most students are unaware of which roles they are suitable for, what specific skills they are missing, and how to plan their learning journey effectively. Existing platforms focus either on teaching skills or listing job opportunities, but they fail to clearly translate a student’s current skill set into industry-relevant roles with actionable guidance. This gap leads to confusion, poor career decisions, and reduced confidence among students.	We propose a Skill Gap Translator that bridges the gap between student skills and industry roles. The system takes a student’s current skills as input and compares them with predefined industry role requirements. It then identifies suitable roles, highlights missing skills for each role, and provides a clear learning roadmap. The solution is designed to be simple, explainable, and scalable, focusing on clarity rather than complex black-box models. This helps students make informed career decisions and plan their skill development effectively.	N

Many individuals either ignore early symptoms or lack timely access to healthcare professionals. There is a critical need for an intelligent system that can analyze symptoms, lifestyle patterns, and medical history to identify potential health risks at an early stage and encourage preventive care. 	We propose an AI-powered early disease detection platform that allows users to input symptoms, lifestyle habits (diet, sleep, physical activity), and basic medical history. Using machine learning models, the system predicts the probability of potential diseases and categorizes the risk level (Low / Medium / High).  The solution provides:  • Early risk alerts  • Personalized health recommendations  • Guidance on when to consult a doctor  The platform focuses on preventive healthcare, accessibility, and data privacy, making it suitable for both urban and rural users.

Which rise issue to the different individual commission. And issue solved by department	Urban citizens frequently encounter civic issues such as damaged roads, garbage accumulation, water supply failures, and emergency situations related to health, fire, or law enforcement, but lack a unified digital platform to report and track these problems efficiently. The “Report and Develop” civic issue reporting system addresses this problem by providing a responsive web-based prototype that allows citizens to report both normal and emergency issues using text, images, videos, audio recordings, and location details. The system enables users to view nearby issues, filter them by category, upvote important problems, and track the status of their own reports as pending, in progress, or resolved. User profiles, theme and language preferences, and issue data are managed using browser localStorage, making the application fully functional without a backend server. Overall, this solution promotes transparency, faster response, and active citizen participation in improving urban infrastructure and public services.	N

Problem Statement In India, most college students and first-time earners have no formal credit history and limited financial guidance. Although students manage income from allowances, stipends, or part-time work, they often lack discipline in managing expenses and savings. As a result: Students overspend without tracking income vs expenses Develop poor financial habits at an early stage Fall into EMI / BNPL traps Get rejected when applying for their first loan due to lack of readiness Traditional financial systems evaluate credit history, not financial discipline, leaving students unprepared and excluded.	Proposed Solution Student Finance Guardian is an AI-powered guidance platform designed specifically for students to: Analyze income and expense behavior Encourage disciplined financial habits Prepare students for future loan readiness The system evaluates financial behavior instead of credit history and generates a Student Financial Readiness Score, along with clear guidance to improve it.  How the Solution Works Student Inputs → AI Analysis → Readiness Score → Actionable Guidance Key Features: Tracks income vs expenses patterns Identifies unhealthy spending habits Guides students on savings and expense control Builds discipline for responsible borrowing	N

Existing emergency solutions fail because they: Depend on voice calls or long forms Require multiple steps during panic Are not usable in silent or threat scenarios Do not guarantee fast routing to the nearest responders As a result, critical response time is lost, turning preventable situations into serious incidents.	Silent SOS is a one-tap emergency alert system that allows users to silently trigger help, automatically sharing their real-time location and emergency type with nearby responders and authorities — without calling or typing. The system is designed for panic-proof usage, where speed, simplicity, and reliability matter more than complexity. Silent SOS is designed to work in panic situations where speed and simplicity are critical. The user opens the application and triggers an emergency by tapping a single SOS button—no login, no typing, and no phone call required. The system works even when the phone is in silent mode, ensuring that the alert can be sent discreetly in sensitive situations. Once activated, the system automatically captures the user’s real-time GPS location without requiring any manual input. This eliminates confusion during emergencies and ensures accurate positioning. The user then selects the type of emergency—Medical, Safety/Harassment, or Accident—so responders can understand the situation and prepare appropriately before reaching the location. The alert is instantly transmitted to multiple endpoints, including campus security or a control room, nearby registered volunteers, and a centralized admin dashboard. This multi-channel routing ensures faster response and reduces dependency on a single authority. On the live admin dashboard, authorities can view the exact location on a map along with the emergency type, timestamp, and alert status (New, Acknowledged, or Resolved). This real-time visibility creates accountability, enables coordinated response, and significantly reduces emergency response time.	N

Most digital learning and productivity tools support students only after deadlines are missed or tasks are completed. However, students often struggle much earlier—when they first open an assignment and do not know how to begin. They hesitate, stay idle, or keep switching between tabs, which leads to unfinished work and loss of productivity. Current systems fail to detect these early hesitation moments and provide timely guidance. There is a need for a system that can identify early signs of hesitation and support students at the right moment, before productivity is lost.	We propose an AI-based system that detects early hesitation patterns when a student starts working on a task, such as inactivity, frequent tab switching, or lack of progress. The system identifies these moments in real time and provides simple, timely guidance to help the student take the next step. By offering support before deadlines are missed, the solution helps prevent productivity loss and improves task completion.	N

Backend: Python (FastAPI/Flask). AI Engine: Google Gemini 3 Pro & Flash (for reasoning & vision). Orchestration: Google AI Studio (Function Calling). Memory: ChromaDB (Vector database for long-term recall).	Current AI assistants are mostly reactive chatbots. They cannot handle complex, multi-step workflows or remember long-term context. Users still have to manually coordinate tasks between different apps. There is a lack of an intelligent assistant that can leverage multimodal context (text + images) to reason through problems and automate decision-making processes efficiently. 	We built AURA, an intelligent agent powered by Google Gemini 3 Pro. Unlike standard bots, AURA utilizes Gemini's massive context window to remember user history and its Function Calling capabilities to structure complex plans. AURA takes a user's vague goal (e.g., "Plan my travel"), breaks it into actionable steps using Gemini's reasoning, and executes the logic.

This includes not only people who are visually impaired, but also those who cannot use their hands properly due to injury, neurological conditions, or long-term physical limitations. Today, such students are forced to depend on human scribes or assistants to write their answers. This creates serious problems: loss of privacy, risk of misinterpretation, delays, uneven quality of support, and in many cases, an unfair assessment of the student’s real knowledge.  Even beyond disability, traditional pen-and-paper exams are a rigid way of testing understanding. Many students are better at explaining ideas by speaking rather than writing long answers under pressure.	We propose a secure, offline-first examination system that allows students to take exams using voice and simple physical controls instead of writing. It is designed for people who cannot write with their hands, visually impaired users, and anyone who prefers spoken responses. The student application can run on desktops, tablets, or mobile devices and is delivered in a containerized form with all required components included. Before the exam, it downloads questions and settings from the server, then switches into a locked exam mode and runs fully offline, allowing students to listen to questions, answer by speaking, repeat, navigate, and submit using buttons or voice commands.  All responses are recorded as audio and converted into text locally, with both stored securely on the device during the exam. Once the exam is finished and internet access is restored, the complete exam data is uploaded to the backend for evaluation. The system supports two user roles: students who take exams through the client app, and administrators who use a separate interface to create exams, review answers, listen to recordings, and assign or verify marks, each through their own secure APIs and data stores.  The backend runs on Google Cloud services to ensure reliability, scalability, and data security. Standard exam-proctoring and software security practices such as encrypted communication, activity logging, and controlled access are followed. By removing the need for human scribes and enabling offline, accessible, voice-based exams, the platform improves fairness, protects privacy, and simplifies exam management for institutions.

Existing study planner applications require constant manual input, frequent typing, and complex interfaces, which discourages regular use—especially during stressful exam periods. As a result, students waste valuable time planning instead of studying, fail to adapt their schedules when plans change, and gradually lose motivation. There is a need for a simple, natural, and time-efficient study planning system that reduces friction and helps students maintain consistent study habits without increasing cognitive load.	The proposed solution is an AI Voice-Controlled Study Planner that allows students to create, update, and manage their study schedules using simple voice commands. Instead of manually typing tasks, students can speak naturally to add subjects, set study durations, reschedule tasks, and track daily progress. The system converts voice input into structured study plans, provides instant feedback, and adapts schedules when plans change. By offering a hands-free, conversational interface through a Command Line Interface (CLI), the solution minimizes effort, saves time, and encourages consistent study behavior. The focus is on simplicity, accessibility, and productivity, making study planning stress-free and intuitive.	N

The healthcare system is generating vast amounts of medical-related information every day. Examples of generated data include the patient's vital sign level monitoring and interpretation (i.e., ECGs, EEGs, etc.), their movement patterns (e.g., gait analysis), the patient's facial expression (facial cues), clinician-supplied clinical notes from doctors, and the patient's long-term health record (i.e., the patient history database).  Currently, no system exists to scan the clinical record to identify emerging medical issues. Most diseases will present with very minimal biological change in the first stage of development, meaning they cannot be identified by a normal physician's examination alone. This is particularly true of rare diseases that can mimic the signs and symptoms of a common disease. Patients suffering from such misdiagnoses will have prolonged suffering due to repeated misdiagnoses and mismanagement of their health condition. This issue is compounded where the patient has no ability to verbally communicate their pain or distress, such as a patient located in an ICU, infant, elderly patient or a patient experiencing neurological impairment. Physicians will often need to rely on detecting delayed or incomplete signs of pain or distress after the patient's medical symptoms have worsened, or complications of illness and/or injury have materialized.  There is currently no existing system available to continuously build on a comprehensive long-term patient data set to find hidden signatures of potential diseases and correlate obscure combinations of signs and/or symptoms.

Switching between AI models makes this worse, as each model operates in isolation with no shared memory. There is no reliable way to compress and transfer an entire conversation—while preserving reasoning and progress—into another AI within prompt limits. This breaks continuity and reduces AI’s effectiveness as a long-term thinking partner.	AI Context Compressor: Seamless cross-AI continuity tool.

Many small and marginal farmers do not have access to soil testing facilities and rely on traditional knowledge, which may not always result in optimal crop yield. Additionally, farmers frequently encounter crop diseases and pests but lack timely expert guidance to identify these problems and apply appropriate treatments. Another major challenge is the communication gap between farmers and agricultural experts, especially for farmers who are not literate or are comfortable only in their local language. Existing agricultural platforms are mostly text-based, limited in regional language support, and do not provide real-time, personalized assistance. Therefore, there is a need for an intelligent, user-friendly system that can recommend suitable crops based on soil nutrients and district-wise environmental data, assist farmers in identifying crop diseases using images, and provide solutions through a conversational interface in local languages using both text and voice.	Proposed Solution This project aims to develop an AI-based Crop Recommendation and Farmer Assistance System that: Recommends suitable crops based on soil nutrient content or district-wise data for farmers who are unaware of their soil composition. Predicts possible crop diseases from uploaded crop images and suggests appropriate preventive and corrective measures. Provides a multilingual AI chatbot that answers farmer queries in local languages using both text and audio. Helps farmers make informed decisions, reduce crop loss, and improve agricultural productivity.	N

These systems lack real-time intelligence and cannot autonomously act on customer queries, delivery updates, revenue trends, or product performance. As a result, businesses face delayed responses, poor visibility, slow issue detection, and increased operational overhead. There is a critical need for an autonomous system that can intelligently understand, decide, and act without human intervention.	We developed a True Agentic AI System that functions as an autonomous business operator. The system uses NLP to understand customer intent, a decision engine to determine optimal actions, and an analytics layer to monitor deliveries, revenue, and product trends. The AI independently responds to customers, tracks deliveries, detects anomalies, and triggers alerts or outreach in real time—without requiring human prompts. This unified intelligence layer transforms reactive automation into proactive, autonomous operations.	N

Quantum-Resistant Secure Digital Records for Low-Connectivity Rural Systems.	As governments, institutions, and organizations increasingly digitize critical records such as identity, land ownership, health data, education certificates, and financial information, security and long-term trust become central challenges—especially in environments with limited connectivity and evolving cyber threats.   We propose a Quantum-Resistant Secure Record Vault, a lightweight backend framework designed to protect sensitive digital records against present-day threats and future quantum attacks. The system uses post-quantum cryptography and an offline-first design, making it suitable for authorized, role-based deployment within government and institutional systems, while remaining scalable across departments and regions and cost-efficient to maintain.

During such situations, drivers struggle to quickly find reliable, nearby assistance, leading to long waiting times, safety risks, and stress. Existing solutions are either fragmented, limited to premium users, require prior app installation, or do not provide real-time availability of service providers. There is a lack of a simple, universal, and fast web-based platform that can instantly connect users facing on-road emergencies with nearby verified mechanics or service providers. This gap highlights the need for an accessible digital solution that ensures timely assistance, location awareness, and reliability during critical on-road situations.	The proposed system is a web-based On-Road Assistance Platform designed to provide quick and reliable roadside support to users facing vehicle breakdowns. The platform eliminates the need for prior mobile application installation and ensures accessibility through any internet-enabled device.  When a user encounters an on-road emergency such as a tyre puncture, engine failure, fuel shortage, or battery issue, the user can access the website and submit an assistance request. The system automatically captures the user’s geographical location using location services and allows the user to specify the type of problem encountered.  Based on the collected information, the system processes the request and identifies the most suitable nearby service provider by analyzing factors such as distance, availability, and service capability. The selected service provider receives the request and can accept or decline it. Upon acceptance, the user is notified with the estimated arrival time and live status updates.  The platform also includes a verification and rating mechanism to ensure service reliability and user safety. All service interactions are logged for monitoring and future improvement. This solution provides a fast, transparent, and reliable digital approach to roadside assistance, reducing response time, enhancing safety, and improving the overall user experience during critical situations.
